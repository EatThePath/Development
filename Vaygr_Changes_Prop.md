# Vaygr

Generally reckoned to be the best race on large maps, Vaygr gameplay is currently consigned to a linear `SCOUT -> MACRO -> BUILD -> PUSH` playstyle. To this end, they are certainly top dog, to the point where the other races stuggle to prevent the macro machine from running out of control.

In addition to nerfing and adding weak points to the unstoppable macro engine, theses changes also attempt to open up more variety in Vaygr play - not just units, but playstyles as well.
