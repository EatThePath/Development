The Homeworld Remastered 2.3 Players Patch resolves many balance issues and bugs from the 2.1 Patch. It includes the changes from Gearboxâ€™s unfinished 2.205 Patch Preview, plus many additional improvements. It enhances multiplayer and singleplayer while respecting Gearbox's direction, and the feel of Relic's classics. Notably it fixes the 666 Formation Bug and is authored by the players who helped Gearbox balance Homeworld Remastered. It also features additional gameplay options including vast unit caps, a campaign difficulty adjuster, and camera zoom / pan adjusters.

Gearbox ended their support, so this is being released by the community for the players and fans. Credits: Gearbox, Cloaked, Kadeshi, Trebic, NoOne, and all the other contributors, testers, and players providing feedback.
