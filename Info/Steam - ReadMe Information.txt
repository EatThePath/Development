The Homeworld Remastered 2.3 Players Patch resolves many balance issues and bugs from the 2.1 Patch. It includes the changes from Gearbox’s unfinished 2.205 Patch Preview, plus many additional improvements. It enhances multiplayer and singleplayer while respecting Gearbox's direction, and the feel of Relic's classics. Notably it fixes the 666 Formation Bug, the Cross Race Docking Bug, and is authored by the players who helped Gearbox balance Homeworld Remastered. It also features additional gameplay options including a campaign difficulty adjuster, camera zoom adjuster, observer mode, vast unit caps, and more.

Gearbox ended their support, so this is being released by the community for the players and fans. Credits: Gearbox, Cloaked, Kadeshi, Trebic, NoOne, Fear, Echo and all the other contributors, testers, and players providing feedback.

[h1]Additional Gameplay Options and Features[/h1]
Gearbox/Relic partially developed some of these options, but never implemented them in the game. By popular demand, they have now been added to HWR.
[b]Game Setup Menu (Multiplayer and Player vs CPU)[/b]
[b] 1.[/b] Observer mode: When your race is set to Observer, you will be able to spectate games.
[b] 2.[/b] Vast unit caps: This is double the size of Huge, and only recommended for very fast machines.
[b] 3.[/b] AI Attack Damage adjuster: This can be used to increase the AI's attack damage for a more challenging game.
[b]Options Menu (Gameplay tab)[/b]
[b] 1.[/b] Camera Pan Speed scale: Adjust/increase the camera speed to move around maps faster with the arrow keys and edge of screen mouse pan. Homeworld must be relaunched for changes to take affect.
[b] 2.[/b] Camera Max Zoom scale: Adjust/increase the maximum distance the camera can zoom out before having to use the sensors manager. Homeworld must be relaunched for changes to take affect.
[b] 3.[/b] Mission Difficulty scale: At the start of each campaign mission, extra enemy reinforcement ships and RU are added based on your fleet size and RU. This dynamic scaling difficulty can now be adjusted. Use 0 for no reinforcements, 0.1-0.9 for less reinforcements, and 1.1-3.0 for more reinforcements. Easy is 0, Normal is 1, Hard is 1.5, Expert is 2+ (double to tripple the difficulty). The mission must be restarted to take effect.
Note: Enemy reinforcements may vary and are only added if the player's fleet is bigger than what the game expects. Reinforcement ships are not in all missions. Specifically Homeworld 1 missions 1, 2, 11, 13; and Homeworld 2 missions 1, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 10. In some missions the dynamic scaling difficulty affects other aspects of the enemy (like RU injections, health, weapon damage, and asteroids). Specifically Homeworld 1 mission 6; and Homeworld 2 missions 5, 6, 8, and 10. To see the reinforcement details, add the -luatrace command line, and check HomeworldRM\Bin\Release\HwRM.log after the mission starts.
[b]Options Menu (UI & HUD tab)[/b]
[b] 1.[/b] Build, Research, and Launch Panel scale: Adjust the size of the Build/Research/Launch menus. The game must be restarted for changes to take effect. Previously these were adjustable, but their size was not saved across games.

[h1]Background[/h1]
Cloaked: I've been playing and modding the Homeworld series since the early 2000's. When Homeworld Remastered was released I placed 1st and 2nd in many [url=https://forums.gearboxsoftware.com/t/gearbox-needs-skilled-experienced-playtesters/208691/1]HWR tournaments[/url]. In June 2015 I was invited to help Gearbox balance HWR. Over the next year I volunteered 1000+ hours as a hobby to help Gearbox balance and test what would become the 2.0/2.1 patches. I ended up working closely with Gearbox's balance designer (scole/thisquietreverie). Many others from the community were involved as well, including Kadeshi, ratamaq, omniconsumer, Hideki, BlackBaps, Alpha_1_SLS, Battlecry, P3G4SU5, etc.

When the 2.0/2.1 patches were released in June 2016 the changes were simply massive. Many balance issues that were missed in testing were quickly identified by the community. I identified solutions for these balance issues and provided them to Gearbox to implement in the Patch Previews. Unfortunately Gearbox ended their support after the 2.205 Patch Preview in July 2016. Over the next 6+ months, it appeared we might get a final patch - but it never materialized. Then in October 2017 Trebic created a fix for the 666 Formation Bug. This got me motivated to finish the final patch, and create the 2.3 Players Patch!

[h1]HWR Compatibility[/h1]
The 2.3 Players Patch works with HWR v2.1 and HWR v2.205. However its recommended to use v2.1, as everyone needs to use the same version for multiplayer. Additionally all the changes from v2.205 are included in the 2.3 Players Patch, except for two developer changes in the exe around ship patching and traceHODs.

[h1]Mod Compatibility[/h1]
HWR lets you select and load multiple mods. However this works best with small mods like maps. For big mods that change many things, you’ll likely need to ask the authors to include these bug fixes/improvements.
