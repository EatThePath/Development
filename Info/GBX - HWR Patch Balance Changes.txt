Here's the details of the balance changes in Homeworld Remastered. I've been helping Gearbox balance these patches since June 2015 with several other people here. Hope you guys like the patches!

## 1.0 to 1.3 Patch Balance Changes
[details=Click to view]
**1.0 to 1.3 Patch Summary -  February 25, 2015 to August 20th, 2015**
There were only bug fixes and minor balance changes between the release of 1.0 and the 1.3 Patch.

**All Races**
Corvettes
Fixed the major [corvette damage bug](https://forums.gearboxsoftware.com/t/videos-details-of-the-laser-missile-corvette-damage-bugs/236237/1). This bug was causing laser and missile corvettes to deal far too much damage, and pulsar corvettes to deal a bit too much as well. These units were never properly balanced from the 1.0 to 1.3 patch.

Fixed a hyperspace issue, where ships would over jump their destination and hit an inhibitor in the distance.

Fixed a [special ability timer issue](https://forums.gearboxsoftware.com/t/marine-infiltrator-cloak-generator-issue/283966/1), where abilities would deplete and recharge twice as fast as they were supposed to.

**Vaygr**
Assault Craft
Reduced the kamikaze damage 92% (to fix an exploit, and be in line with similar ships)

Missile Corvettes and Laser Corvettes
Fixed a bug where they were not affected by Gravity Well Generators.

**Kushan and Taiidan**
Repair Corvettes
Health decreased 50%

Support Frigates
Health decreased 9%
Speed increased 17%

Destroyers
Health increased 6%

Missile Destroyers
Health increased 6%

**Note:**
In addition to the changes listed above, many weapons were tweaked a bit. But these didn't really do much to improve the balance problems in 1.0 to 1.3. After the 1.3 patch, Gearbox released several versions of the Official Gearbox Balance Mod from August to September 2015. This was later replaced by the 2.0 Patch.

## 2.0 Patch Balance Changes
[details=Click to view]
**2.0 Patch Summary - June 7th, 2016**
Kushan and Taiidan have seen major changes to better reflect their Homeworld 1 Classic (hw1c) performance and for better balance against Hiigaran and Vaygr. Hiigaran and Vaygr are largely the same as in Homeworld 2 Classic (hw2c), but with several improvements and many tweaks for better balance vs hw1 races.

Several features from hw1c have been brought back and added to all the races. Aggressive/Neutral/Evasive Stance's to boost damage or speed. Formation's have small damage/accuracy/speed modifiers for different ships. Balistic/simulation features, for example idle ships are generally a lot easier to hit than moving ships now. Useful scuttle blast damage for most ships. This all adds a lot of depth to the game.

Harvesting for all races has been balanced. Hiigaran has stayed the same, Vaygr has been brought up to par (was about 5+% lower), Kushan now matches Hiig, and Taiidan has been brought up to par with Kushan.

## Hiigaran and Vaygr 
I'll quote Scole on by far the biggest change: "Single tiered upgrades. Yes, there was a definite strategy between the original HW2 races that is lost but now there are two races without upgrades who must remain a viable play option. HW2 base stats for ships are higher than Classic and when upgraded ships usually fall close to where they would have been at the level 2 upgrade. For HW2 races this frees up Resources that can be used elsewhere. Vaygr, with their particularly expensive family-wide upgrades benefit from this."

Fire Control Tower/Vaygr Command Corvette damage and accuracy boost lowered from 15% to 7%. Maximum damage/accuracy stack lowered from 40% to 20%. This was done to balance the late game vs hw1 races which don't have these.

The new unit cap system counts fighters and corvettes by individual ship rather than by squad for consistency across all 4 races. This is a silent buff to ships with small squad sizes including: scouts, minelayers, and command corvettes.

Hyperspace Inhibitors
Cost 1500->1000 to balance vs hw1 races that can hyperspace from the start of the game

Carrier Fighter/Corvette/Frigate Facilities
Health up 40% to be closer to the mothership facilities health. This was to balance vs hw1 races which do not have subsystems.

Capital Ship Facilities
Health up 30% to make them stronger than fighter/corvette/frigate facilities and to balance vs hw1 races which do not have subsystems.

Below I've listed anything notable that's changed more than 5%. Health/Speed changes are for fully upgraded ships. The move to single tiered upgrades caused many ship's health and speed to change by small percentages such as 1%-15%, and that's just how things shook out.

Resource Collectors
Health up 25% to balance vs hw1 collectors which start with far more health. Interceptor damage vs collectors was also increased to keep the early game hw2c balance.

Fighters
The health of each hw2 fighter has gone up from 30 to 90, but the attack of their counters has also gone up to match. They have been balanced close to their prior performance. This was done to better balance the new features including formations and stances, and to improve battle outcome consistency. Balancing 30 hp one shot kill fighters became a fools errand with the new features.

Scouts
Cost: 350->300 was one of the final tweaks to balance vs hw1 races
now unit capped at 18 (6 squads). Was necessary since they take up way less space in the new unit cap system.
EMP duration 35->20 seconds. Idle ships now take way more damage, so EMP had to be adjusted.

Interceptors/Assault Craft
Cost: 500->450 was one of the final tweaks to balance vs hw1 races

Bombers
Health: up 50% more than interceptors are now, to improve survive-ability.
Got a sizable attack buff. They should now be a better capital ship counter.

Pulsar, Gunship, Missile and Laser Corvettes
Health up 12%

Destroyers
Reduced the size of the engine subsystems to minimize a hw2c issue where destroyers broadsiding each other would often absorb a lot of bullet damage with their engines.
Unit cap: 7->5 (was 5 in hw2c)

Battlecruisers
Unit cap: 3->2

Shipyards
Speed up 25%

Probes
Cost 150->70

Proximity Sensors
Cost 250->150

Health down 7%
Speed down 20%

Ion Platforms
Health Upgrade Costs 1300->1200
Health down 7%
Speed down 20%

Scouts
Generally all ship's base hull and speed increased, while fully upgraded stats stayed the same. This ship didn't have upgrades, so their base stats received a bump.
Speed 460->512 (was 480 in hw2c)

Interceptors
Speed Upgrades Costs are still 800, maybe the only upgrade that didn't change in price.

Bombers
Speed Upgrade Costs 800->600

Gunship Corvettes
Attack buffed, this ship was under-powered.
Health Upgrade Costs 1250->800
Speed Upgrade Costs 800->400

Pulsar Corvettes
Attack balanced against Vaygr missile corvettes (corvettes had balance issues since release due to several bugs, and bug fixes)
Health Upgrade Costs 1150->1200
Speed Upgrade Costs 1050->600

Minelayers

Ion Frigates
Is now better able to shoot idle corvettes, like salvage corvettes.
Health Upgrade Costs 2200->1000
Speed Upgrade Costs 1250->600

Marines
Fixed a hw2c oversight where every ship in the game had 100% accuracy vs marine/infiltrator frigates. Now they are treated as a regular frigates for accuracy calculations, which is a silent buff.
Unit cap 5->6

Defense Field Frigates
Generally all ship's base hull and speed increased, while fully upgraded stats stayed the same. This ship didn't have upgrades, so their base stats received a bump.
Health up 11%
Speed up 9%
Unit cap 4->2. It was 2 in hw2c, and stacking 4 DFF can be quite overpowered.
The following changes incentivize more usage:
Cost 1250->1000
Build Speed 70->60 seconds
Duration 20->32 seconds

Destroyers
Health Upgrade Costs: 2500->1500
Speed Upgrade Costs: 2500->600
Health down 18%
Health regen improved 28%
Attack up 5% vs frigates, and down 30% vs resource collectors.

Battlecruisers
Health Upgrade Costs: 5000->1500
Speed Upgrade Costs: 2500->600
Health down 22%
Speed up 6%
Attack down 28%

Motherships
Health Upgrade Costs 1250->1000

Health up 9%

Shipyards
Fixed a hw2c bug with their cloak module
Health Upgrade Costs 2250->1000
Speed Upgrade Costs 2000->600
Health down 34% (now about the same as hw2c)



## Vaygr

Utility Ships
Health Upgrade Costs 3600->1200

Resource Collectors
RU load per trip 200->208
Speed up 1.4%
Now start with 7 collectors instead of 6 (Yes the Vaygr mothership is that bad at harvesting).

Platforms
Health Upgrade Costs 2600->1500

Gun and Missile Platforms
Health down 12%
Speed down 20%

Hyperspace Platforms
Cost 750->375
Speed up 8%
Has a minor sensors distortion probe effect for itself only, to incentivize its use.

Fighter Unit Cap
In HWR Public it was 15 squads, but in hw2c it was 18 squads. Now its set to 108 individual fighters to target the hw2c balance. Build possibilities:
4 scout squads (3 per squad) + 14 interceptor squads (7 per squad)
16 interceptor squads (7 per squad)
18 bomber squads (6 per squad)
18 lance squads (5 per squad) + 3 interceptor squads (7 per squad)

Fighters
Speed Upgrade Costs 1600->1200

Scouts
Cost 350->300
Speed down 7%
EMP research cost 1000->1500 To balance the reduction of fighter speed upgrade costs and scout costs.

Bombers
Vaygr bomber damage has been improved to be closer to Hiig (longstanding hw2c issue)

Lance Fighters
Attack buffed, was under-powered and very niche

Corvettes
Health Upgrade Costs 2700->1600
Speed Upgrade Costs 2400->1000

Missile Corvettes
Attack balanced against Hiigaran pulsar corvettes. (corvettes had balance issues since release due to several bugs, and bug fixes)

Laser Corvettes
Attack balanced close to hw2c performance vs frigs and capital ships. (corvettes had balance issues since release due to several bugs, and bug fixes)
Fixed a bug where they lose DPS when corvette speed was upgraded.

Minelayer Corvettes
Base Health 400->900
Upgraded Health 640->1,350
Before they were easy to snipe since they weren't a squad of 3.

Command Corvettes
Ping ability added, doesn't require any additional research
Health increased 40% to match minelayer change
Now flies around in battle instead of siting idle so they aren't such easy targets.
Unit capped at 2. The new unit cap system is a silent buff to these, and too many command corvettes would have been quite unbalanced for the other races. Also now that battlecruisers are unit capped at 2, Hiigaran is unlikely to have more than 2 FCT's in a battle.

Frigates
Health Upgrade Costs 4400->2000
Speed Upgrade Costs 2500->1200

Assault Frigates
Attack buffed, this ship was under-powered
Assault frigate research cost 650->500
Health down 7%

Heavy Missile Frigates
Is now better able to shoot idle corvettes, like salvage corvettes.
Range up 14% to prevent Hiig Ion frigates from kitting them.

Infiltrator Frigates
Fixed a hw2c oversight where every ship in the game had 100% accuracy vs marine/infiltrator frigates. Now they are treated as a regular frigates for accuracy calculations, which is a silent buff.
Generally all ship's base hull and speed increased, while fully upgraded stats stayed the same. However due to the above, Hiig marine frigates and Vaygr Infiltrator frigates didn't received any base speed/health changes. Since there's only one teir of upgrades now, this means the fully upgraded Vaygr infiltrator frigate is a bit lower than before:
Speed down 7%
Health down 12%

Capital Ships
Health Upgrade Costs: 10,000->3,000
Speed Upgrade Costs: 8,500->1,500

Destroyers
See above, upgrades are now 14,000ru cheaper
Health down 18%
Health regen improved 28%
Attack up 5% vs frigates

Battlecruisers
Range now matches Hiig battlecruiser to prevent kitting
See above, upgrades are now 14,000ru cheaper
Health down 22%
Speed up 6%
Damage down 28%

Flagships
Health down 35% (up 9% from hw2c)
Speed down 7%

Carriers
Health up 29%
Cost 1700->1900
Bombers got buffed, so we wanted to make sure fragile Vaygr carriers wouldn't go poof early game. Costs were notched up a bit since the health went up so much.

Shipyards
Health down 26% (now about the same as hw2c)



## Kushan and Taiidan
I'll quote Scole again here: "The [patch] contains edits to [hundreds of] files. The complexity of the interactions the changes have on the game would make itemizing every change lunacy so instead we will speak to some of the general changes... ...It will not and can not be an exhaustive, comprehensive list. You will have to play to really feel it out."

Generally speaking, Kushan and Taiidan ships perform a lot closer to hw1c while being better balanced against Hiigaran and Vaygr. Below I've noted some of the more important changes, and provided some ship role/performance information.

Research costs/times adjusted to allow a hw1 player to choose to start at either fighters, corvettes or frigates and to be better balanced vs hw2 races.

Fighters and corvettes have received big speed buffs, to match upgraded hw2 ships.

Scouts
Cheap anti-fighter, not quite as strong as interceptors.

Interceptors
Balanced against hw2 interceptors when in formations. Tip: small formations like a Claw or X of about 5 ships, are going to perform better than lose ships not in a formation.

Defenders
Unit capped at 20

Bombers
Better at countering capital ships than before.
No longer require plasma bomb research in multiplayer.

Kushan Cloaked Fighters
Anti-fighter, and good vs utility ships
Unit capped at 20

Taiidan Defense Fighters
Still good at killing missiles, but not so overpowered vs Vaygr anymore.
Unit capped at 10

Repair Corvettes
Repair is much better than before.
No longer require any research like in hw1c.

Salvage Corvettes
Speed increased 150->255

Light Corvettes
Cheap anti fighter
Just require corvette drive research like in hw1c.

Multigun Corvettes
Better anti-fighter

Heavy Corvettes
Anti-corvette balanced against pulsar corvettes and missile corvettes. Also pretty good vs frigates and capital ships.

Minelayer Corvettes
Health increased like hw2 minelayers were

Support Frigate
Repair is much better than before, your going to want to use these.

Assault Frigates
Anti-corvette, not very good vs fighters unless they are trapped in a gravity well. Pretty good vs frigates too.
Health and speed changed closer to upgraded Hiig/Vaygr frigates:
Health up 72%
Speed up 47%

Ion Frigates
Health and speed changed closer to upgraded Hiig/Vaygr frigates:
Health up 53%
Speed up 27%
Attack: balanced against Hiig ion frigates

Kushan Drone Frigates
Shreds interceptors pretty fast, pretty good vs corvettes too.
Drone duration greatly increased.

Taiidan Field Frigate
Now equipped with a new field that's always on.
Unit capped at 2, as 2 of these stacked stops 95+% of bullets. Like in hw1c, these don't block ions or missiles.

Destroyers
Now requires Ion Cannon research due to their Ion based weaponry, like in hw1c.
Now requires Super Heavy Chassis (carriers and destroyers were swapped in the tech tree)
Built Time 178->160 seconds (between hw2 destroyers with and without improved manufacturing research)
Health up 10%
Health regen improved 42%
Speed up 41%
Unit capped at 5
Attack balanced against hw2 destroyers. 

Missile Destroyers
Good vs fighters and corvettes now
Unit capped at 2

Heavy Cruisers
Now requires Ion Cannon research due to their Ion based weaponry, like in hw1c.
Cost 3600->4500
Built Time 293->250 seconds (between hw2 cruisers with and without improved manufacturing research)
Health up 20%
Health regen improved 20%
Speed up 27%
Unit capped at 2
Balanced to be a bit weaker than hw2 battlecruisers. However these are very strong when combined with repair units.

Resource Collectors
Built Time 60->50 seconds
Health down 17%
Can now hyperspace

Resource Controllers
No longer requires any research.
Can now support 8 resource collectors, and is much closer to the performance of their hw2 equivalents.

Gravity Wells
Research cost 700->500
Health up 33%
Hyperspace inhibitor effect range increased to be closer to the hw2 hyperspace inhibitor range
Gravity well ability range reduced to more closely match the hw1c range.
Ability duration 90->45 seconds (Idle ships now take way more damage)
No recharge like in hw1c, however the ability can be turned on/off at any time.
Now always reduce enemy accuracy within their inner ring. Basically the opposite of a fire control tower for accuracy, due to the gravity distortion.

Motherships
Hyperspace costs increased from 500base/1300max to 1000base/1500max. This better balances hw1's ability to hyperspace from the very start of the game.

Carriers
Health up 37%
No longer requires super heavy chassis research. This gives players more flexibility in choosing their next upgrade path, and provides better balance vs hw2 races.

Note: For ship health I've provided the actual effective health, what's displayed in game can be off by 20% sometimes due to armor damage modifiers.

Gearbox's 2.205 [Patch Preview](http://forums.gearboxsoftware.com/t/announcement-public-patch-preview/1512431/1) resolved most of the [2.1 Patch Balance Issues](https://forums.gearboxsoftware.com/t/2-1-patch-balance-issues/1512184/1). Unfortunately Gearbox ended support for HWR prior to rolling this out as a full patch. The 2.205 Patch Preview can be opted into on Steam as a beta, or downloaded as part of the 2.3 Players Patch.

Missile Corvettes
Damage vs fighters down 55% (they now perform closer to hw2c)
Fixed a bug where they would deal zero damage to probes

Laser Corvettes
Fixed a bug with the attack script where laser corvettes would start doing evasive maneuvers and rarely attacking. This bug fix makes laser corvettes much more effective.

Capital Ship Health Upgrade
Cost 3000->4000 (to balance vs Hiig)
Research Time up 5%

Capital Ship Speed Upgrade

Damage vs hw2 resource collectors down 25%

Ion Frigates
Ion Cannon Research: Research Time up 50->90 (same timing, considering the capital ship chassis research buff)

## 2.3 Players Patch Changes
[details=Click to view]
**2.3 Players Patch Summary - March 8, 2018 Update**
The community created [2.3 Players Patch](https://forums.gearboxsoftware.com/t/homeworld-remastered-2-3-players-patch/1639142/1) resolves many balance issues and bugs from the 2.1 Patch. It includes the changes from Gearbox’s unfinished 2.205 Patch Preview, plus many additional improvements. It enhances multiplayer and singleplayer while respecting Gearbox's direction, and the feel of Relic's classics. Notably it fixes the 666 Formation Bug and is authored by the players who helped Gearbox balance Homeworld Remastered.

## Gameplay and UI Options
Gearbox/Relic partially developed some of these options, but never implemented them in the game. By popular demand, they have now been added to HWR:
Added a Vast unit cap option. This is double the size of Huge, and only recommended for very fast machines.
Added a Mission Difficulty adjuster. At the start of each campaign mission, extra enemy AI reinforcement ships and RU are added based on your fleet size and RU. This dynamic scaling difficulty can now be adjusted.
Added a Camera Pan Speed adjuster. This lets players increase the camera speed to move around maps faster with the arrow keys and edge of screen mouse pan.
Added a Camera Max Zoom adjuster. This lets players increase the maximum distance the camera can zoom out before having to use the sensors manager.
Added a Build/Research/Launch Panel adjuster. This lets players set and save the size of the Build/Research/Launch menus in the options. Previously these were adjustable, but their size was not saved across games.

## HWR Bugs Fixes and Improvements
Fixed the build/research/launch menu scaling problem, that primarily affects 4k resolutions
Fixed the build and research queue pause buttons, so that they no longer get disabled
Improved the spacing in the build/research queues for better readability.
Fixed the race specific research tabs, so that they are hidden based on the race your playing
Fixed Hiigaran Gunship weapon sound effects (they were playing pulsar sounds)
Fixed Taiidan Resource Controller nlips clipping (docked collectors would appear inside the controller when zoomed out)
The 'Research Ship Complete' audio is now played after each additional Kushan/Taiidan Research Ship Hub is built.
Kushan Research Ship's with all six hubs, now spin like they did in hw1c.
Kushan/Taiidan corvettes now respond quickly to certain attack orders, without a long delay.
Removed Kushan/Taiidan repair ships from military selection priority.
Fixed Kushan and Taiidan Repair Corvette sound effects (so they no longer play gun noises while repairing)
Fixed the major cross race docking bug on the Kushan Support Frigate.
Fixed Kushan Destroyer ion cannon sound effects
Fixed the player colors on the Kushan Heavy Cruiser ion turrets.
Fixed Taiidan's Emperor voice, when playing the 'Homeworld 1 Deathmatch' game type (it was playing Vaygr's Makaan voice)
In the Strikecraft & Support Only game mode, Kushan Drone Technology research is now disabled as intended.
In the Strikecraft & Support Only game mode, Vaygr carrier health now matches the other races as intended.
More details on HWR's bugs can be found here: https://forums.gearboxsoftware.com/t/hwr-bugs-solutions/1639765/1

## Balance
The bulk of the balance changes are from Gearbox's 2.205 Patch Preview, as described above. Additional changes are listed below.

## All Races
Fixed the major [666 Formation Targeting Bug](https://forums.gearboxsoftware.com/t/666-formation-targeting-bug/1541832/1) - Formations and squadrons now perform as they were intended to!

With the 666 bug resolved, all fighters went through a very thorough balance testing process. Tweaks were made as needed to align them with intended balance that Gearbox and the balance testers had crafted.

Reduced the amount of small low-RU debris for destroyers and cruisers. This improves the game's performance in long games.

Hyperspace exit damage lowered from 25% to 10%, when running into a hyperspace inhibitor

Probe cost 70->100 (half way between hw1c and hw2c)
All probe health down 50% (its now half way between hw1c and hw2c, as some ships were taking too long just to kill a probe.)

High Unit Caps: Cruisers 4->3

## Hiigaran and Vaygr 
Resource Collectors
Kamikaze damage up 500% (a typo gave them much less damage than intended)
Default stance is now Evasive (Evasive stance provides slightly faster harvesting)

Gun Platforms, Ion Platforms, Missile Platforms
Speed up 25% (to match hw2c)

Carriers and Battle Cruisers
Death/scuttle blast range down some (so fighters and corvettes can better survive capital ship battles)

## Hiigaran
Ion Platforms
Damage down 17% (same as hw2c)

Bombers
Speed Upgrade Costs 600->400 (to balance vs Vaygr)
Hiigaran bombers now check their line of fire like the other races do, to avoid friendly fire incidents

Gunship Corvettes
Kamikaze damage down 20%

Pulsar Corvettes
Damage vs hw2 corvettes down 33% (to balance vs Vaygr)

Defense Field Frigates
Cost 1000->1250 (to match hw2c)
Build Time 60->70 (to match hw2c)

Shipyards
Addressed a gun alignment bug. They were shooting to the side of their targets, and rarely landing hits vs small targets like probes, fighters, and corvettes.

## Vaygr
Platforms
Health Upgrade Costs 1500->1600 (to balance vs Hiigaran)

Missile Platforms
Damage down 15% (same as hw2c)

Scouts
Addressed a gun alignment bug. They were shooting to the side of their targets, and rarely landing hits vs small targets like probes and fighters.

Corvettes
Health Upgrade Costs 1600->1800 (to balance vs Hiigaran)

Missile Corvettes
Kamikaze damage down 40% (to close a potential exploit)

Laser Corvettes
Kamikaze damage down 14% (to close a potential exploit)
Laser Corvettes were the only corvettes negatively impacted by the 666 Bug. They are now performing as intended: the best anti-frigate and anti-capital ship corvette in the game.

Heavy Missile Frigates
Range down 6% (closer to hw2c)

## Kushan and Taiidan
Resource Collectors
Kamikaze damage up 400% (a typo gave them much less damage than intended)
Default stance is now Evasive

Research Ship
Speed up 55%
Taiidan Health up 50% to match Kushan Health (to fix a mistake from the 2.1 patch)

Scouts
Kushan and Taiidan Scouts are now balanced, previously Kushan would always win. (Not intended)

Interceptors
Kushan and Taiidan Interceptors are now balanced, previously Taiidan would always win. (Not intended)

Corvettes
Now move around their targets a lot more in combat (similar to hw1c)

Multi-Gun Corvettes
Cost 300->235
Research time down 36%
(general buffs, and to balance vs Hiigaran/Vaygr)

Heavy Corvettes
No longer prioritize attacking fighters (since they aren't very good vs fighters)
Kushan and Taiidan Heavy Corvettes are now balanced, previously Taiidan would always win. (Not intended)
Cost 285->240
Build time down 9%
Research time down 33%
(general buffs, and to balance vs Hiigaran/Vaygr)

Destroyers
Build Time 160->145 seconds (to balance vs Hiigaran/Vaygr)

Missile Destroyers
Damage vs hw1 corvettes down 40% (now performs similar vs hw1 and hw2 corvettes)
Speed up 12% (relatively similar to hw1c)

Sensors Array
Speed up 72% (relatively similar to hw1c)

Gravity Well Generators
Can now be repaired (like in hw1c)

Cloak Generators
Ability range up 100%

## Campaign Missions
In Homeworld 1, updated the parade formations to better handle salvaged ships.
In Homeworld 1 mission 2 & 4, fixed the turanic missile corvette's missile burn effects.
In Homeworld 1 mission 3, increased the cryo tray health to be closer to hw1c gameplay. (Gearbox increased the health on most Kushan/Taiidan ships to balance vs Hiigaran/Vaygr upgrades, but forgot some campaign only ships).
In Homeworld 1 mission 4, increased turanic ion array frigate speed to be relatively similar to hw1c.
In Homeworld 1 mission 4, the objective is now complete as soon as the carrier is killed, rather than after the explosion animation finishes (to prevent a timing error).
In Homeworld 1 mission 7 & 8, properly balanced kushan ships vs swarmers to better reflect hw1c gameplay. Corrected swarmer behavior so they dock correctly, and don't stop attacking unexpectedly.
In Homeworld 1 mission 7, the enemy AI reinforcements now work properly based on your starting fleet value.
In Homeworld 1 mission 7, fixed an issue where the multi-gun corvette research sometimes doesn't get enabled. 
In Homeworld 1 mission 8, increased kadesh multi-beam frigate health and speed to be relatively similar to hw1c.
In Homeworld 1 mission 8, lowered the accuracy of the kadesh mothership ion cannons vs moving fighters and corvettes.
In Homeworld 1 mission 8, kadesh ships now properly defend the final area like in hw1c.
In Homeworld 1 mission 10, fixed the camera location at the start of the mission.
In Homeworld 2 mission 2, the mothership's engine speed now matches the audio cues and hw2c.
In Homeworld 2 mission 2, the transport ships' speed now increases after events as they did hw2c. 
In Homeworld 2 mission 2, increased Captain Soban's weapon damage to match hw2c.
