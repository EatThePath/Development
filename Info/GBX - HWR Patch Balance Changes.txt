Here's the details of the balance changes in Homeworld Remastered. I've been helping Gearbox balance these patches since June 2015 with several other people here. Hope you guys like the patches!




# 1.0 to 1.3 Patch Balance Changes
[details=Click to view]
## 1.0 to 1.3 Patch Summary -  February 25, 2015 to August 20th, 2015
There were only bug fixes and minor balance changes between the release of 1.0 and the 1.3 Patch.

### All Races
__Corvettes__
Fixed the major [corvette damage bug](https://forums.gearboxsoftware.com/t/videos-details-of-the-laser-missile-corvette-damage-bugs/236237/1). This bug was causing laser and missile corvettes to deal far too much damage, and pulsar corvettes to deal a bit too much as well. These units were never properly balanced from the 1.0 to 1.3 patch.

Fixed a hyperspace issue, where ships would over jump their destination and hit an inhibitor in the distance.

Fixed a [special ability timer issue](https://forums.gearboxsoftware.com/t/marine-infiltrator-cloak-generator-issue/283966/1), where abilities would deplete and recharge twice as fast as they were supposed to.

### Vaygr
__Assault Craft__
Kamikaze damage -92% (to fix an exploit, and be in line with similar ships)

__Missile Corvettes and Laser Corvettes__
Fixed a bug where they were not affected by Gravity Well Generators.

### Kushan and Taiidan
__Repair Corvettes__
Health -50%

__Support Frigates__
Speed +17%
Health -9%

__Destroyers__
Health +6%

__Missile Destroyers__
Health +6%

__Note:__
In addition to the changes listed above, many weapons were tweaked a bit. But these didn't really do much to improve the balance problems in v1.0 to v1.3. After the 1.3 patch, Gearbox released several versions of the Official Gearbox Balance Mod from August to September 2015. This was later replaced by the 2.0 Patch.

# 2.0 Patch Balance Changes
[details=Click to view]
## 2.0 Patch Summary - June 7th, 2016
Kushan and Taiidan have seen major changes to better reflect their Homeworld 1 Classic (hw1c) performance and for better balance against Hiigaran and Vaygr. Hiigaran and Vaygr are largely the same as in Homeworld 2 Classic (hw2c), but with several improvements and many tweaks for better balance vs hw1 races.

Several features from hw1c have been brought back and added to all the races. Aggressive/Neutral/Evasive Stance's to boost damage or speed. Formation's have small damage/accuracy/speed modifiers for different ships. Balistic/simulation features, for example idle ships are generally a lot easier to hit than moving ships now. Useful scuttle blast damage for most ships. This all adds a lot of depth to the game.

Harvesting for all races has been balanced. Hiigaran has stayed the same, Vaygr has been brought up to par (was about 5+% lower), Kushan is now closer Hiig, and Taiidan has been brought up to par with Kushan.




### Hiigaran and Vaygr 
I'll quote Scole on by far the biggest change: "Single tiered upgrades. Yes, there was a definite strategy between the original HW2 races that is lost but now there are two races without upgrades who must remain a viable play option. HW2 base stats for ships are higher than Classic and when upgraded ships usually fall close to where they would have been at the level 2 upgrade. For HW2 races this frees up Resources that can be used elsewhere. Vaygr, with their particularly expensive family-wide upgrades benefit from this."

Fire Control Tower/Vaygr Command Corvette damage and accuracy boost lowered from 15% to 7%. Maximum damage/accuracy stack lowered from 40% to 20%. This was done to balance the late game vs hw1 races which don't have these.

The new unit cap system counts fighters and corvettes by individual ship rather than by squad for consistency across all 4 races. This is a silent buff to ships with small squad sizes including: scouts, minelayers, and command corvettes.

Below I've listed anything notable that's changed more than 5%. Health/Speed changes are for fully upgraded ships. The move to single tiered upgrades caused many ship's health and speed to change by small percentages such as 1%-15%, and that's just how things shook out.

__Hyperspace Inhibitors__
Cost 1500->1000 to balance vs hw1 races that can hyperspace from the start of the game

__Carrier Fighter/Corvette/Frigate Facilities__
Health +40% to be closer to the mothership facilities health. This was to balance vs hw1 races which do not have subsystems.

__Capital Ship Facilities__
Health +30% to make them stronger than fighter/corvette/frigate facilities and to balance vs hw1 races which do not have subsystems.

__Resource Collectors__
Health +25% to balance vs hw1 collectors which start with far more health. Interceptor damage vs collectors was also increased to keep the early game hw2c balance.

__Fighters__
The health of each hw2 fighter has gone up from 30 to 90, but the attack of their counters has also gone up to match. They have been balanced close to their prior performance. This was done to better balance the new features including formations and stances, and to improve battle outcome consistency. Balancing 30 hp one shot kill fighters became a fools errand with the new features.

__Scouts__
Cost: 350->300 was one of the final tweaks to balance vs hw1 races
now unit capped at 18 (6 squads). Was necessary since they take up way less space in the new unit cap system.
EMP duration 35->20 seconds. Idle ships now take way more damage, so EMP had to be adjusted.

__Interceptors/Assault Craft__
Cost: 500->450 was one of the final tweaks to balance vs hw1 races

__Bombers__
Health: up 50% more than interceptors are now, to improve survive-ability.
Got a sizable attack buff. They should now be a better capital ship counter.

__Pulsar, Gunship, Missile and Laser Corvettes__
Health +12%

__Shipyards__
Speed +25%

__Destroyers__
Health -18%
Health regen improved 28%
Attack +5% vs frigates
Reduced the size of the engine subsystems to minimize a hw2c issue where destroyers broadsiding each other would often absorb a lot of bullet damage with their engines.
Unit cap: 7->5 (was 5 in hw2c)

__Battlecruisers__
Speed +6%
Health -22%
Damage -28%
Unit cap: 3->2

__Probes__
Cost 150->70

__Proximity Sensors__
Cost 250->150




### Hiigaran

__Resource Collectors__
Health Upgrade Costs 1200->800

__Resource Controllers__
Health Upgrade Costs 1500->400

__Gun Platforms__
Health Upgrade Costs 1300->700
Speed -20%
Health -7%

__Ion Platforms__
Health Upgrade Costs 1300->1200
Speed -20%
Health -7%

__Scouts__
Generally all ship's base hull and speed increased, while fully upgraded stats stayed the same. This ship didn't have upgrades, so their base stats received a bump.
Speed 460->512 (was 480 in hw2c)

__Interceptors__
Speed Upgrades Costs are still 800 (maybe the only upgrade that didn't change in price)

__Bombers__
Speed Upgrade Costs 800->600

__Gunship Corvettes__
Speed Upgrade Costs 800->400
Health Upgrade Costs 1250->800
Attack buffed, this ship was under-powered.

__Pulsar Corvettes__
Speed Upgrade Costs 1050->600
Health Upgrade Costs 1150->1200
Attack balanced against Vaygr missile corvettes (corvettes had balance issues since release due to several bugs, and bug fixes)

__Minelayers__
Health 400->900 Before they were easy to snipe since they weren't a squad of 3.

__Torpedo Frigates__
Speed Upgrade Costs 1250->600
Health Upgrade Costs 2200->1000
Attack lowered vs fighters.

__Flak Frigates__
Speed Upgrade Costs 1250->600
Health Upgrade Costs 2200->1000

__Ion Frigates__
Speed Upgrade Costs 1250->600
Health Upgrade Costs 2200->1000
Is now better able to shoot idle corvettes, like salvage corvettes.

__Marines__
Fixed a hw2c oversight where every ship in the game had 100% accuracy vs marine/infiltrator frigates. Now they are treated as a regular frigates for accuracy calculations, which is a silent buff.
Unit cap 5->6

__Defense Field Frigates__
Generally all ship's base hull and speed increased, while fully upgraded stats stayed the same. This ship didn't have upgrades, so their base stats received a bump.
Speed +9%
Health +11%
Unit cap 4->2. It was 2 in hw2c, and stacking 4 DFF can be quite overpowered.
The following changes incentivize more usage:
Cost 1250->1000
Build Speed 70->60 seconds
Ability Duration 20->32 seconds

__Motherships__
Speed Upgrade Costs 1250->600
Health Upgrade Costs 1250->1000
Speed -7%
Health -33% (+5% from hw2c)

__Carriers__
Speed Upgrade Costs 1500->600
Health Upgrade Costs 1750->1000
Health +9%

__Shipyards__
Speed Upgrade Costs 2000->600
Health Upgrade Costs 2250->1000
Health -34% (now about the same as hw2c)
Fixed a hw2c bug with their cloak module

__Destroyers__
Speed Upgrade Costs: 2500->600
Health Upgrade Costs: 2500->1500
Attack -30% vs resource collectors.

__Battlecruisers__
Speed Upgrade Costs: 2500->600
Health Upgrade Costs: 5000->1500




### Vaygr

__Utility Ships__
Health Upgrade Costs 3600->1200

__Resource Collectors__
RU load per trip 200->208
Speed +1.4%
Now start with 7 collectors instead of 6 (Yes the Vaygr mothership is that bad at harvesting).

__Platforms__
Health Upgrade Costs 2600->1500

__Gun and Missile Platforms__
Speed -20%
Health -12%

__Hyperspace Platforms__
Speed +8%
Cost 750->375
Has a minor sensors distortion probe effect for itself only, to incentivize its use.

__Fighter Unit Cap__
In HWR Public it was 15 squads, but in hw2c it was 18 squads. Now its set to 108 individual fighters to target the hw2c balance. Build possibilities:
4 scout squads (3 per squad) + 14 interceptor squads (7 per squad)
16 interceptor squads (7 per squad)
18 bomber squads (6 per squad)
18 lance squads (5 per squad) + 3 interceptor squads (7 per squad)

__Fighters__
Speed Upgrade Costs 1600->1200

__Scouts__
Cost 350->300
Speed -7%
EMP research cost 1000->1500 To balance the reduction of fighter speed upgrade costs and scout costs.

__Bombers__
Vaygr bomber damage has been improved to be closer to Hiig (longstanding hw2c issue)

__Lance Fighters__
Attack buffed, was under-powered and very niche

__Corvettes__
Speed Upgrade Costs 2400->1000
Health Upgrade Costs 2700->1600

__Missile Corvettes__
Attack balanced against Hiigaran pulsar corvettes. (corvettes had balance issues since release due to several bugs, and bug fixes)

__Laser Corvettes__
Attack balanced close to hw2c performance vs frigs and capital ships. (corvettes had balance issues since release due to several bugs, and bug fixes)
Fixed a bug where they lose DPS when corvette speed was upgraded.

__Minelayer Corvettes__
Base Health 400->900
Upgraded Health 640->1,350
Before they were easy to snipe since they weren't a squad of 3.

__Command Corvettes__
Ping ability added, doesn't require any additional research
Health increased 40% to match minelayer change
Now flies around in battle instead of siting idle so they aren't such easy targets.
Unit capped at 2. The new unit cap system is a silent buff to these, and too many command corvettes would have been quite unbalanced for the other races. Also now that battlecruisers are unit capped at 2, Hiigaran is unlikely to have more than 2 FCT's in a battle.

__Frigates__
Speed Upgrade Costs 2500->1200
Health Upgrade Costs 4400->2000

__Assault Frigates__
Assault frigate research cost 650->500
Health -7%
Attack buffed, this ship was under-powered

__Heavy Missile Frigates__
Is now better able to shoot idle corvettes, like salvage corvettes.
Range +14% to prevent Hiig Ion frigates from kitting them.

__Infiltrator Frigates__
Fixed a hw2c oversight where every ship in the game had 100% accuracy vs marine/infiltrator frigates. Now they are treated as a regular frigates for accuracy calculations, which is a silent buff.
Generally all ship's base hull and speed increased, while fully upgraded stats stayed the same. However due to the above, Hiig marine frigates and Vaygr Infiltrator frigates didn't received any base speed/health changes. Since there's only one teir of upgrades now, this means the fully upgraded Vaygr infiltrator frigate is a bit lower than before:
Speed -7%
Health -12%

__Capital Ships__
Speed Upgrade Costs: 8,500->1,500
Health Upgrade Costs: 10,000->3,000

__Flagships__
Speed -7%
Health -35% (+9% from hw2c)

__Carriers__
Cost 1700->1900
Health +29%
Bombers got buffed, so we wanted to make sure fragile Vaygr carriers wouldn't go poof early game. Costs were notched up a bit since the health went up so much.

__Shipyards__
Health -26% (now about the same as hw2c)

__Destroyers__
See above, upgrades are now 14,000ru cheaper

__Battlecruisers__
Range now matches Hiig battlecruiser to prevent kitting
See above, upgrades are now 14,000ru cheaper




### Kushan and Taiidan
I'll quote Scole again here: "The [patch] contains edits to [hundreds of] files. The complexity of the interactions the changes have on the game would make itemizing every change lunacy so instead we will speak to some of the general changes... ...It will not and can not be an exhaustive, comprehensive list. You will have to play to really feel it out."

Generally speaking, Kushan and Taiidan ships perform a lot closer to hw1c while being better balanced against Hiigaran and Vaygr. Below I've noted some of the more important changes, and provided some ship role/performance information.

Research costs/times adjusted to allow a hw1 player to choose to start at either fighters, corvettes or frigates and to be better balanced vs hw2 races.

Fighters and corvettes have received big speed buffs, to match upgraded hw2 ships.

__Resource Collectors__
Built Time 60->50 seconds
Health -17%
Can now hyperspace

__Resource Controllers__
No longer requires any research.
Can now support 8 resource collectors, and is much closer to the performance of their hw2 equivalents.

__Scouts__
Cheap anti-fighter, not quite as strong as interceptors.

__Interceptors__
Balanced against hw2 interceptors when in formations. Tip: small formations like a Claw or X of about 5 ships, are going to perform better than lose ships not in a formation.

__Defenders__
Unit capped at 20

__Bombers__
Better at countering capital ships than before.
No longer require plasma bomb research in multiplayer.

__Kushan Cloaked Fighters__
Anti-fighter, and good vs utility ships
Unit capped at 20

__Taiidan Defense Fighters__
Still good at killing missiles, but not so overpowered vs Vaygr anymore.
Unit capped at 10

__Repair Corvettes__
Repair is much better than before.
No longer require any research like in hw1c.

__Salvage Corvettes__
Speed increased 150->255

__Light Corvettes__
Cheap anti fighter
Just require corvette drive research like in hw1c.

__Multigun Corvettes__
Better anti-fighter

__Heavy Corvettes__
Anti-corvette balanced against pulsar corvettes and missile corvettes. Also pretty good vs frigates and capital ships.

__Minelayer Corvettes__
Health increased like hw2 minelayers were

__Support Frigate__
Repair is much better than before, your going to want to use these.

__Assault Frigates__
Anti-corvette, not very good vs fighters unless they are trapped in a gravity well. Pretty good vs frigates too.
Health and speed changed closer to upgraded Hiig/Vaygr frigates:
Speed +47%
Health +72%

__Ion Frigates__
Health and speed changed closer to upgraded Hiig/Vaygr frigates:
Speed +27%
Health +53%
Attack: balanced against Hiig ion frigates

__Kushan Drone Frigates__
Shreds interceptors pretty fast, pretty good vs corvettes too.
Drone duration greatly increased.

__Taiidan Field Frigate__
Now equipped with a new field that's always on.
Unit capped at 2, as 2 of these stacked stops 95+% of bullets. Like in hw1c, these don't block ions or missiles.

__Motherships__
Hyperspace costs increased from 500base/1300max to 1000base/1500max. This better balances hw1's ability to hyperspace from the very start of the game.

__Carriers__
Health +37%
No longer requires super heavy chassis research. This gives players more flexibility in choosing their next upgrade path, and provides better balance vs hw2 races.

__Destroyers__
Now requires Ion Cannon research due to their Ion based weaponry, like in hw1c.
Now requires Super Heavy Chassis (carriers and destroyers were swapped in the tech tree)
Built Time 178->160 seconds (between hw2 destroyers with and without improved manufacturing research)
Speed +41%
Health +10%
Health regen improved 42%
Unit capped at 5
Attack balanced against hw2 destroyers. 

__Missile Destroyers__
Good vs fighters and corvettes now
Unit capped at 2

__Heavy Cruisers__
Now requires Ion Cannon research due to their Ion based weaponry, like in hw1c.
Cost 3600->4500
Built Time 293->250 seconds (between hw2 cruisers with and without improved manufacturing research)
Speed +27%
Health +20%
Health regen improved 20%
Unit capped at 2
Balanced to be a bit weaker than hw2 battlecruisers. However these are very strong when combined with repair units.

__Gravity Wells__
Research cost 700->500
Health +33%
Hyperspace inhibitor effect range increased to be closer to the hw2 hyperspace inhibitor range
Gravity well ability range reduced to more closely match the hw1c range.
Ability duration 90->45 seconds (Idle ships now take way more damage)
No recharge like in hw1c, however the ability can be turned on/off at any time.
Now always reduce enemy accuracy within their inner ring. Basically the opposite of a fire control tower for accuracy, due to the gravity distortion.

Note: For ship health I've provided the actual effective health, what's displayed in game can be off by 20% sometimes due to armor damage modifiers.

Gearbox's 2.205 [Patch Preview](http://forums.gearboxsoftware.com/t/announcement-public-patch-preview/1512431/1) resolved most of the [2.1 Patch Balance Issues](https://forums.gearboxsoftware.com/t/2-1-patch-balance-issues/1512184/1). Unfortunately Gearbox ended support for HWR prior to rolling this out as a full patch. The 2.205 Patch Preview can be opted into on Steam as a beta, or downloaded as part of the 2.3 Players Patch.

### Hiigaran and Vaygr

__Flak Frigates__
Damage vs hw1 fighters increased 64% (results in a decent buff)

__Battlecruisers__
Range +3%
Fixed an issue where the hiigaran battlecruiser would sometimes sit pointed 10 degrees up or down vs a target on the same vertical level - causing the nose of the ship to block one ion turret from attacking.

__Motherships__
Speed Upgrade Cost 600->400
Health Upgrade Cost 1000->800

__Carriers__
Speed Upgrade Cost 600->400

__Missile Corvettes__
Damage vs fighters -55% (they now perform closer to hw2c)
Fixed a bug where they would deal zero damage to probes

__Laser Corvettes__
Fixed a bug with the attack script where laser corvettes would start doing evasive maneuvers and rarely attacking. This bug fix makes laser corvettes much more effective.

Research Time +12% (to same as hw2c)
Damage vs Hiig/Vaygr fighters -50% (results in a small nerf)
Damage vs hw1 fighters +400% (results in a decent buff)

__Battlecruisers__
Trinity Cannon Range +1%
Damage vs capital-ships -6% (with no micro, makes 1 hiigaran cruiser vs 1 vaygr cruiser consistently come out even like in hw2c. With micro, vaygr can slightly out-range hiigaran and win.)

__Carriers__
Cost 1900->2100

__Capital Ship Health Upgrade__
Cost 3000->4000 (to balance vs Hiig)
Research Time +5%

__Capital Ship Speed Upgrade__
Cost 1500->2000 (to balance vs Hiig)

Damage vs corvettes -50%
Damage vs hw2 resource collectors -25%

__Ion Frigates__
Ion Cannon Research Time up 35->64 (same timing, considering the capital ship chassis research buff)
Damage vs frigates -24% (they still beat hw2 ion frigates with 10% health left. This was a big oversight in balance testing the 2.0 patch.)

__Carriers__
Damage vs fighters +25%
Damage vs hw2 resource collectors -45%

# 2.3 Players Patch Changes
[details=Click to view]
## 2.3 Players Patch Summary - build 8 - August 4, 2018
The community created [2.3 Players Patch](https://forums.gearboxsoftware.com/t/homeworld-remastered-2-3-players-patch/1639142/1) resolves many balance issues and bugs from the 2.1 Patch. It includes the changes from Gearbox’s unfinished 2.205 Patch Preview, plus many additional improvements. It enhances multiplayer and singleplayer while respecting Gearbox's direction, and the feel of Relic's classics. Notably it fixes the 666 Formation Bug, the Cross Race Docking Bug, and is authored by the players who helped Gearbox balance Homeworld Remastered.



## Gameplay Options and Features
Gearbox/Relic partially developed some of these options, but never implemented them in the game. By popular demand, they have now been added to HWR:
-Added a Vast unit cap option. This is double the size of Huge, and only recommended for very fast machines.
-Added a Mission Difficulty adjuster. At the start of each campaign mission, extra enemy AI reinforcement ships and RU are added based on your fleet size and RU. This dynamic scaling difficulty can now be adjusted.
-Added an AI Attack Damage adjuster to multiplayer and player vs cpu. This can be used to increase the AI's attack damage for a more challenging game.
-Added an Observer mode to spectate multiplayer matches.
-Added a Camera Pan Speed adjuster. This lets players increase the camera speed to move around maps faster with the arrow keys and edge of screen mouse pan.
-Added a Camera Max Zoom adjuster. This lets players increase the maximum distance the camera can zoom out before having to use the sensors manager.
-Added a Build/Research/Launch Panel adjuster. This lets players set and save the size of the Build/Research/Launch menus in the options. Previously these were adjustable, but their size was not saved across games.



## HWR Bugs Fixes and Improvements
-Addressed the major Cross Race Docking Bug. Fighters and corvettes will now only dock with ships from their own race. Previously, regenerated Hiigaran/Vaygr ships would be unable to launch from Kushan/Taiidan Repair Corvettes, Support Frigates, and Resource Controllers leading to major game lag and multiple glitches.
-Fixed the build/research/launch menu scaling problem, that primarily affects 4k resolutions
-Fixed the build and research queue pause buttons, so that they no longer get disabled
-Improved the spacing in the build/research queues for better readability.
-Fixed the race specific research tabs, so that they are hidden based on the race your playing
-Fixed Hiigaran Gunship weapon sound effects (they were playing pulsar sounds)
-Fixed Taiidan Resource Controller nlips clipping (docked collectors would appear inside the controller when zoomed out)
-The 'Research Ship Complete' audio is now played after each additional Kushan/Taiidan Research Ship Hub is built.
-Kushan Research Ship's with all six hubs, now spin like they did in hw1c.
-Kushan/Taiidan corvettes now respond quickly to certain attack orders, without a long delay.
-Kushan/Taiidan repair units now have a continous beam like hw1c
-Removed Kushan/Taiidan repair ships from military selection priority.
-Fixed Kushan and Taiidan Repair Corvette sound effects (so they no longer play gun noises while repairing)
-Kushan Ion Cannon Frigates are now pronounced correctly as 'Cannon', previously they were being pronounced as 'Cannit'.
-Fixed Kushan Destroyer ion cannon sound effects
-Fixed the player colors on the Kushan Heavy Cruiser ion turrets.
-Kushan/Taiidan accuracy reduction abilities are now painted orange in the tactical overlay
-Fixed Taiidan's Emperor voice, when playing the 'Homeworld 1 Deathmatch' game type (it was playing Vaygr's Makaan voice)
-Improved parade formations for resource collectors, to reduce collisions with the motherships.
-Expert Taiidan AI now harvests resources at the same rate as the other races. (it was 10% higher by mistake)
-In the Strikecraft & Support Only game mode, Kushan Drone Technology research is now disabled as intended.
-In the Strikecraft & Support Only game mode, Vaygr carrier health now matches the other races as intended.
-Reduced the amount of small low-RU debris for destroyers and cruisers. This improves the game's performance in long games.

## Campaign
__Homeworld 1__
-Fixed a rules of engagement bug that caused many Turanic, Kadeshi, and Junkyard ships to sometimes stop attacking unexpectedly and behave passively.
-Updated the parade formations to better handle salvaged ships.
-Fixed the Turanic Missile Corvette's missile burn effects.
-Captured Turanic Standard Corvettes can now be repaired.
-Captured Turanic Ion Array Frigates and Kadeshi Multi-beam Frigates can now be retired immediately.
-Increased Turanic Ion Array Frigate speed to be relatively similar to hw1c.
-Updated research costs to match multiplayer, and research times to 1.5x slower than multiplayer (the campaign research is slower paced). These hadn't been updated since HWR v1.0. Mission resources were also adjusted to support the changes.
-Properly balanced kushan ships vs swarmers to better reflect hw1c gameplay. Corrected swarmer behavior so they dock correctly, and don't stop attacking unexpectedly.
__Mission 3__
-Increased the cryo tray health to be closer to hw1c gameplay. (Gearbox increased the health on most Kushan/Taiidan ships to balance vs Hiigaran/Vaygr upgrades, but forgot some campaign only ships).
__Mission 4__
-The objective is now complete as soon as the carrier is killed, rather than after the explosion animation finishes (to prevent a timing error).
__Mission 7__
-The enemy AI reinforcements now work properly based on your starting fleet value.
-Fixed an issue where the multi-gun corvette research sometimes doesn't get enabled. 
__Mission 8__
-Increased kadesh multi-beam frigate health and speed to be relatively similar to hw1c.
-Lowered the accuracy of the kadesh mothership ion cannons vs moving fighters and corvettes.
-Kadesh ships now properly defend the final area like in hw1c.
__Mission 10__
-Fixed the camera location at the start of the mission.

__Homeworld 2__
-Fixed a rules of engagement bug that caused Keeper ships to sometimes stop attacking unexpectedly and behave passively.
-Applied some research cost/build time changes from the 2.0, 2.1, and 2.205 patches. These changes were made in multiplayer, but were accidently missed in the campaign. The campaign research stats now better match multiplayer.
-The base health of Vaygr missile platforms, destroyers, cruisers, and flagships have been slightly tweaked to align with multiplayer as they did in hw2c.
__Mission 2__
-The mothership's engine speed now matches the audio cues and hw2c.
-The transport ships' speed now increases after events as they did hw2c. 
-Increased Captain Soban's weapon damage to match hw2c.
__Mission 5__
-Lowered the Vaygr captial ship health upgrade to be closer to hw2c. (this was unintentionally altered in the 2.0 patch)
__Mission 13__
-Lowered the Vaygr corvette, frigate, and captial ship health upgrades to be closer to hw2c. (these were unintentionally altered in the 2.0 patch)



## Balance
Many of the balance changes are from Gearbox's 2.205 Patch Preview, as described above. Additional changes are listed below.



### All Races
-Fixed the major [666 Formation Targeting Bug](https://forums.gearboxsoftware.com/t/666-formation-targeting-bug/1541832/1) - Formations and squadrons now perform as they were intended to!
-With the 666 bug resolved, all fighters and corvettes went through a very thorough balance testing process. Tweaks were made as needed to align them with intended balance that Gearbox and the balance testers had crafted.
-Balanced dock repair times for fighters and corvettes (addressed a bug that caused squadrons to dock extremely fast. hw2 ships now repair slower, closer to their hw2c rate. hw1 corvettes repair 4.5x faster than before, to balance vs hw2.)
-Lowered death/scuttle blast range on carriers and battle cruisers (so fighters and corvettes can better survive capital ship battles)
-Hyperspace exit damage lowered from 25% to 10%, when running into a hyperspace inhibitor
-High Unit Caps adjusted so cruisers are capped at 3, rather than 4.
-Tweaked rotational speeds on some units, for example to aid in positioning motherships around asteriod patches.
-Removed evasive stance bonuses from non-combat/utility ships (evasive stance re-routes power from weapons to engines, however this is not possible on non-combat ships and had no effect in hw1c)
-Kamikaze damage adjusted on some units to close potential exploits, and resolve typos.
-Tweaked ship damage vs resourcing units, to be closer to the classics.
-Thousands of ship vs ship tests have been performed with Gearbox's developer balance testing tools, to fine tune combat performance.

__Probes__
-Cost 70->100 +43% (half way between hw1c and hw2c)
-Health 800->400 -50% (its now half way between hw1c and hw2c, as some ships were taking too long just to kill a probe.)



### Hiigaran and Vaygr 
__Resource Collectors__
-Upgraded Health 5000->4000 -20% (to match hw2c)

__Gun Platforms__
-Speed 100->125 +25% (to match hw2c)

__Ion Platforms, Missile Platforms__
-Speed 100->125 +25% (to match hw2c)
-Damage -16% (same as hw2c)

__Bombers__
-Damage vs corvettes -30%

__Minelayer Corvettes__
-Cost 800->400 -50% (buff, hw1 are 275)
-Damage bonus in aggressive stance 1.32->1.1 -17%

__Destroyers__
-Health 85k->90k +6% (+13% over v2.1, closer to hw2c when upgraded by popular demand)



### Hiigaran
__Bombers__
-Speed Upgrade Costs 600->400 (to balance vs Vaygr)
-Hiigaran bombers now check their line of fire like the other races do, to avoid friendly fire incidents

__Pulsar Corvettes__
-Damage vs hw2 corvettes -33% (to balance vs Vaygr)
-Damage vs frigates -10%

__Defense Field Frigates__
-Cost 1000->1250 +25% (to match hw2c)
-Build Time 60->70 +17% (to match hw2c)
-Health 20k->25k +25% (since this ship can't be upgraded, Taiidan Field Frigate is 30k)

__Shipyards__
-Addressed a gun alignment bug. They were shooting to the side of their targets, and rarely landing hits vs small targets like probes, fighters, and corvettes.



### Vaygr
__Resource Collectors__
-Resource capacity 208->200 -4% (Now matches Hiigaran to better balance harvesting. Vaygr still start with one extra collector to make up for their Flagship's long collector drop off route. Harvesting for all four races is now within 1% of each other.)

__Platforms__
-Health Upgrade Costs 1500->1600 (to balance vs Hiigaran)

__Hyperspace Platforms__
-Build Time 45->20sec (these took too long to setup)
-Speed 650->600 -8% (to match hw2c as they should not be faster than a probe)

__Scouts__
-Addressed a gun alignment bug. They were shooting to the side of their targets, and rarely landing hits vs small targets like probes and fighters.

__Corvettes__
-Health Upgrade Costs 1600->1800 (to balance vs Hiigaran)

__Missile Corvettes__
-Damage vs hw1 fighters +110% (now performs similarly vs hw1 and hw2 fighters)

__Laser Corvettes__
-Laser Corvettes were the only corvettes negatively impacted by the 666 Bug. They are now performing as intended: the best anti-frigate and anti-capital ship corvette in the game.

__Command Corvettes__
-Build time 30->45sec +50% (slows down the replenishment of these powerful units)
-Attack/accuracy bonus range -51% (forces these ships to be on the front line so they can be countered)

__Heavy Missile Frigates__
-Range -6% (closer to hw2c)


### Kushan and Taiidan
-Overhauled Kushan and Taiidan. These races were rushed into HWR at release, and repeatedly band-aided over the previous patches. All ship speeds, health, costs, build times, and research costs/times are now consistently translated into the HWR engine, with a robust design methodology. Kushan and Taiidan now feel much more like hw1 classic, while being better balanced against Hiigaran and Vaygr.
-Harvesting for all four races is now within 1% of each other at the 10, 20, and 30 minute marks. Previously hw1 was behind hw2 at 10mins, and ahead at 30minutes. Harvesting is also now better balanced on maps with different asteriod layouts.
-Generally research costs have gone up, while research times have come down. This improves balance vs hw2 upgrade costs, while allowing hw1 to tech up faster, eliminating some pain points.
-Adjusted base health to remove hidden armour modifiers from all ships other than frigates. Relic only applied armour modifiers to frigates, however Gearbox used them sporadically on hw1 units. The ship health values listed below are the actual effective health.
-Corvettes now move around their targets a lot more in combat (similar to hw1c)
-Race specific unit abilities now perform closer to hw1c, details are below.
