Note: All proposed changes are suggestions/ideas, until deemed final.


# Build 10 Change List
- Dropped "2.3" from the Players Patch name.


## Gameplay Options and Features
- Observers now start with 0 ru. When prompted to continue watching, click yes to observe.
- In the carrier only gamemode, all races now start with the same number of carriers.
- Added an extra tactical overlay level that keeps feedback lines and circles on all the time when desired.
- Added an option to change the default tactical overlay level.
- Added an option to show base build/research production times.


## HWR Bugs Fixes and Improvements
- Whenever someone sends a private message, everyone in the lobby hears the sound even when they are not the recipient. Removed the sound, as the chat window already visually flashes for the recipient.
- ‘Platform Complete’ audio is now played for Vaygr Gun Platforms and Missile Platforms
-- Note: these sounds aren't localized.
- Fixed the hyperspace in inhibitor exploit.
- Don't include in list, but gave more space for longer names in the build menu!
- Super minor/prolly don't mention: Improved text spacing in the build/research menues.
- The score screen building and research total now treats ru spent on subsystems the same as ru spent on research.
- HW1 cruisers no longer take hyperspace damage. (test to make sure this works!)
- When a docking squadron is under attack, they sometimes glitch and stop. This issues another dock order to dock with the closest ship.
